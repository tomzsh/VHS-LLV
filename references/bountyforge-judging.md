# Finding Gate Evaluation (Judging) — ported from BountyForge

Ported from https://github.com/Gabson0x/bountyforge (references/judging.md,
v3.0.0, (c) Gabson0x / Synq Studio, MIT public GitHub) into vhs for P5
triage. Complements `p5-triage.md` and `taxonomy-rating.md`.

Every deduplicated finding passes four sequential gates. Fail any gate →
**REJECTED** or **DEMOTED** to LEAD. Later gates are not evaluated for failed
findings.

---

## Gate 1 — Refutation

Construct the strongest argument that the finding is wrong. Find the guard,
check, or constraint that kills the attack — quote the exact line and trace
how it blocks the claimed step.

- **Concrete refutation** (a specific guard blocks the exact claimed step) →
  **REJECTED** (or **DEMOTE** if a code smell remains worth investigating)
- **Speculative refutation** ("probably wouldn't happen", "likely intended") →
  **clears**, continue to Gate 2

## Gate 2 — Reachability

Prove the vulnerable state exists in a live/deployed system.

- **Structurally impossible** (enforced invariant in code prevents the state
  from ever occurring) → **REJECTED**
- **Requires privileged actions outside normal operation** (owner must
  misconfigure, multi-sig must collude) → **DEMOTE**
- **Achievable through normal usage, fee-on-transfer tokens, rebasing,
  common admin actions** → **clears**, continue to Gate 3

## Gate 3 — Trigger

Prove an unprivileged (or minimally privileged) actor can execute the attack
profitably.

- **Only a trusted role can trigger** → **DEMOTE** (report as medium/low, not
  critical)
- **Costs exceed extraction** (attack costs more than it gains) → **REJECTED**
- **Unprivileged actor can trigger profitably** → **clears**, continue to Gate 4

## Gate 4 — Impact

Prove material harm to an identifiable victim.

- **Self-harm only** (attacker loses their own funds/data, no other victim) →
  **REJECTED**
- **Dust-level, non-compounding, no cascade** → **DEMOTE** to low/informational
- **Material loss to identifiable victim** (user funds drained, protocol
  shutdown, data breached) → **CONFIRMED**

---

## Severity Adjustment After Gates

After all four gates clear, adjust severity downward if:

- Attack requires specific timing (e.g., within 1 block window): **-1 severity
  level**
- Attack requires non-trivial capital (>$100K flash loan for medium-value
  target): **-1 severity level**
- Impact is bounded (attacker can profit but not drain the entire pool):
  **-1 severity level**
- Fix is already deployed on mainnet but not in the reviewed commit:
  **DEMOTE** + note

## LEAD Promotion Before Finalization

Before finalizing the LEAD list, promote where warranted:

1. **Cross-contract echo:** Same root cause confirmed as FINDING in target A →
   promote in target B where identical pattern appears (confidence 75).
2. **Multi-agent convergence:** 2+ agents flagged the same area, finding was
   demoted (not rejected) → promote to FINDING at confidence 75.
3. **Partial path completion:** Only weakness is an incomplete trace, but path
   is reachable and unguarded → promote to FINDING at confidence 75, no fix
   required.
4. **Web cross-feature:** Confirmed auth bypass in endpoint A enables IDOR in
   endpoint B → chain them and promote.

## Do Not Report

- Linter warnings, compiler suggestions, gas micro-optimizations.
- Missing NatSpec or event emissions.
- Centralization risk without an exploit path.
- Admin privileges functioning as designed (unless the design itself is the
  vulnerability).
- Implausible preconditions that require the protocol to already be
  compromised.
- Self-XSS without any escalation path.
- Logout CSRF without session fixation.
- Rate limiting that genuinely prevents exploitation in the defined threat
  model.
